              Hello! I hail from a small town two hours east of Seattle. I am currently working to complete the UW Coding Bootcamp with the goal of entering into the tech industry! My employment history has never included anything tech related (as of yet) so I will not mention former accomplishments. I did graduate with my BA in Criminal Justice back in 2014 but never really used it in the work force. I am excited to launch into a tech career and learn as much as I can! My porfolio page has examples of my work and I will continue to update it with new projects as they are completed.
